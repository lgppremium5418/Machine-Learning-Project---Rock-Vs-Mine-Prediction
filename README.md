# Machine-Learning-Project---Rock-Vs-Mine-Prediction
Objective: Developed a machine learning model to predict whether underwater objects are rocks or mines using logistic regression.

Methodology: Employed logistic regression, a binary classification algorithm, to analyze features extracted from sonar signals, including frequency patterns and amplitude variations.

Achievements:

-- Successfully trained and tested the model on a labeled dataset, achieving high accuracy in classifying rocks and mines.
-- Implemented rigorous validation techniques to ensure robustness and reliability of the model.
-- Contributed to underwater navigation, security, and environmental monitoring by providing a reliable tool for identifying potential hazards.
